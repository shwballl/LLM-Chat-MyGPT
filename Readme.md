**LLM-Chat-MyGPT** is a personal project designed to explore and understand the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Python. It serves as a learning platform to experiment with LLM capabilities, including backend and frontend interactions.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Purpose**:Educational exploration of LLMs with Python
- **Components**:
  - `backend/`:Contains server-side code for handling LLM interactions
  - `frontend/`:Houses the client-side interface for user interactions
- **Technologies Used**:Python, JavaScript, CSS, FastAPI for the backend, and Astro for the frontend

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or highr
- Node.js and npm (for frontend developmen)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shwballl/LLM-Chat-MyGPT.git
   cd LLM-Chat-MyGPT
   ```


2. **Set Up Backend**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
    Create a virtual environment and activate i:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
    Install dependencie:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
    Install dependencie:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    Start the backend serve:
     ```bash
     cd ../backend
     uvicorn src.main:app --reload
     ```
    Start the frontend development serve:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm run dev
     ```

## 🛠️ Usage

Once both servers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:4321/` in your browser to interact with the applicatin You can input queries, and the backend will process them using the integrated LM.
